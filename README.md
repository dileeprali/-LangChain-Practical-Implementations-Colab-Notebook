# -LangChain-Practical-Implementations-Colab-Notebook
This repository contains practical, hands-on implementations of key LangChain concepts using Google Colab. The examples demonstrate real-world usage of LangChain with the OpenAI API and Hugging Face models, making it easy to understand and apply modern LLM-based workflows.

📘# What's Inside
Explore and experiment with the following LangChain components:

🔧 LLM Integration: Using OpenAI and Hugging Face models for text generation

🧠 Prompt Templates: Structuring prompts for consistent LLM outputs

⛓️ Chains: Basic and advanced chain structures

🧬 Sequential Chains: Linking multiple steps with shared context

🕵️ Agents: Building intelligent agents capable of tool use and dynamic decision-making

💾 Memory Modules:

ConversationBufferMemory

ConversationChain

ConversationBufferWindowMemory

🎯 Goal
The goal of this notebook series is to provide a clear, beginner-friendly, and modular introduction to LangChain's powerful features — perfect for developers, researchers, or hobbyists looking to build LLM-powered applications.
